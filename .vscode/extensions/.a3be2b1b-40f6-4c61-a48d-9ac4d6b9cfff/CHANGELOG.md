# Change Log
All notable changes to the "metago" extension will be documented in this file.

## Todo List:
   - [x] close issues. 
   - [x] support real viewport range, not use config
   - [x] jumper support fold region    
   - [x] Color settings support referencing [Theme Color Id](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color)
   - [x] sequential-target-chars support: type a sequence of target-chars, and dynamically change decoration codes while typing, at any time type the decoration codes to navigate. This means we provide two sets of codes one set is the target chars sequence and another set is the dynamically generated decorators. you could type the chars sequence as long as you want to narrow down the searched possible locations, and then type the decoration codes to got the the exact location.
   - [x] add following char decorator in sequential-target.
   - [x] jump commands could be triggered event editor not focused, has any open editor
   - [x] left border on jump code decorator support
   - [x] fix enter key at end of sequential-target jump
   - [x] backspace as command to delete last input char: could done by registered as textEditor command
   - [x] bookmark: one bookmark in one line, toggle-bookmark command works when cursor not at char location. char location is still used when goto the bookmark.
   - [x] target chars is only used for narrow down searching range, not for navigation. solve the problem of typing multi target chars together may edit document by mistake
   - [x] ripple search support, type location-chars to trigger far from center: one char nearby; two char current doc; three chars all opened editors
   - [x] bug: metaJump: '/' key could not be used as following sequence key, if already used as decorator hide key. fix it by disable sequential-target-chars if it used as the target char.
   - [x] Line selection up/down command: ? editorHasSelection
      ~~make Ctrl+L into a line command trigger: if the user press i(means up, configurable), triggers the selecting up subCommand, in this subCommand the user can press i again or press k (mean down) several times. Ctrl+L, k is select down subCommand trigger. any other key other than i,k would escape this command~~
      Ctrl+o to extendLineSelection up when has selection
   - [x] metaJump: contributed command: metaGo.Cancel doesn't exist.
   - [x] exclude <br> from start tag regex
   - [ ] metaJump: `alt+backspace` to delete to.
   - [ ] bracketJump: level navigate. context conditional variable when cursor at bracket. ctrl+shift+P[ or ] to go to previous/ next level.
   - [ ] alt+back to delete with metaJump
   - [ ] metaJump: backspace to cancel last input decoration code.
   - [ ] ctrl+i i ': select in '; ctrl+i a ': select ' and content;
   - [ ] pair-selection: support mutiline start-pair
   - [ ] space-word: cursor move, delete, select
   - [ ] alt+g *: cursor to char forward, alt+f *: cursor to char backward.
   - [ ] bookmark: use treeView and implement tag mark.
   - [ ] metaSelection: active selection's cursor should be special to identify, when there are multiple selections or multiple cursors
   - [ ] extend selecttobracket alt+shift+\ command to do further extension
   - [ ] inSurroundingPairSelection: pairs configuration
   - [ ] inSurroundingPairSelection: tag selection support
   - [ ] metaJump: alt+/ then ctrl+alt+/ could cancel and press ctrl+alt+/ to trigger.
   - [ ] add useful my command config into package.json. i.e. Ctrl+Alt+back to delete small word left
   - [ ] Create command for move to previous/next member
## Todo List for V4
